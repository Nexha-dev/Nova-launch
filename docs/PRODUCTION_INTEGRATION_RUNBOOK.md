# Production Integration Runbook

End-to-end checklist for deploying Nova Launch to production. Follow steps in order. Each section has a checkpoint — do not proceed until it passes.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, confirm:

- [ ] You have `soroban` CLI installed and `admin` identity configured
- [ ] You have funded mainnet accounts (`admin`, `treasury`)
- [ ] `STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet` is set in your shell or `.env.mainnet`
- [ ] The WASM artifact is built and optimized (see Step 1)
- [ ] Backend `.env` is populated (see `backend/.env.example`)
- [ ] Frontend `.env` is populated (see `frontend/.env.example`)

---

## Step 1 — Build and Optimize Contract

```bash
cd contracts/token-factory
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
soroban contract optimize \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/token_factory.wasm
```

**Checkpoint:** File `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/token_factory.optimized.wasm` exists and is non-zero.

---

## Step 2 — Deploy Contract

```bash
# From repo root
STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet ./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh
```

> The script writes `deployment-mainnet.json` and `.env.mainnet` with the new contract ID.

**Checkpoint:**

```bash
cat deployment-mainnet.json | jq .contractId
# Expected: 56-character string starting with "C"
```

---

## Step 3 — Update Frontend Environment

```bash
./scripts/update-frontend-env.sh
# Then copy mainnet values:
cp .env.mainnet frontend/.env
```

Verify `frontend/.env` contains:

```
VITE_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID=<56-char contract ID>
VITE_NETWORK=mainnet
```

**Checkpoint:** `grep VITE_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID frontend/.env` returns the contract ID from Step 2.

---

## Step 4 — Run Database Migrations

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Checkpoint:** Command exits 0. No pending migrations remain:

```bash
npx prisma migrate status
# Expected: "All migrations have been applied"
```

---

## Step 5 — Start Backend and Event Listener

```bash
cd backend
ENABLE_EVENT_LISTENER=true npm start
```

**Checkpoint:**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health | jq .data.status
# Expected: "ok"
```

---

## Step 6 — Build and Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ to your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
vercel --prod   # or equivalent
```

**Checkpoint:** The deployed URL loads without a blank screen or boot error banner.

---

## Step 7 — Smoke Test

Run the full smoke test against the live deployment:

```bash
STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet \
FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID=$(jq -r .contractId deployment-mainnet.json) \
./scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

Expected output: all checks pass with `✓`.

For a full frontend + backend + chain integration check:

```bash
./scripts/fullstack-smoke-test.sh
```

**Checkpoint:** No `✗` lines in output.

---

## Step 8 — Verify Deployment

```bash
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```

**Checkpoint:** Script exits 0 and prints `Deployment verified`.

---

## Rollback

If any step fails after contract deployment:

```bash
# Find the backup created by upgrade-contract.sh or deploy-testnet.sh
ls backups/

# Restore previous contract
./scripts/rollback-upgrade.sh backups/<timestamp> mainnet
```

After rollback:

1. Re-run Step 3 to point frontend at the restored contract ID.
2. Re-run Step 7 smoke test to confirm the rollback is functional.

> See [rollback-upgrade.sh](../scripts/rollback-upgrade.sh) for details.

## Post-Deploy Verification Checklist

| Check | Command | Expected |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Contract state | `soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --network mainnet -- get_state` | JSON with `is_paused: false` |
| Backend health | `curl /health` | `{"data":{"status":"ok",...}}` |
| Frontend loads | Open deployed URL | No error banner |
| Wallet connects | Connect Freighter | Address shown in header |
| Fee display | Open Deploy page | Shows 7 XLM base fee |
| Explorer links | Click any tx link | Opens stellar.expert/explorer/public |

---

## Environment Variable Reference

| Variable | Where | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | shell / `.env.mainnet` | `testnet` or `mainnet` |
| `FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` | `.env.mainnet` | Deployed contract address |
| `VITE_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` | `frontend/.env` | Same value, Vite prefix |
| `VITE_NETWORK` | `frontend/.env` | `testnet` or `mainnet` |
| `ENABLE_EVENT_LISTENER` | backend env | `true` to start chain listener |
| `DATABASE_URL` | backend env | Postgres connection string |
